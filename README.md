# Crab-Age-MLP-Deep-NN

****
Using multilayer perceptron (MLP) Neural Networks to predict the age of crabs based on a number of numerical and catagorical features
****

Context
----
This data set explores many interesting predictive features of crabs. We will use these features to help predict the age of the crab that they belong to.

Data Set
----
The data is made up of serveral numerical and catagorical features that we will explore in the following notebook
